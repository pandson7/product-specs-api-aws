# Jira User Stories for Product Specifications API Project

## Story 1: Implement Flexible JSON Product Data Storage in DynamoDB

**Issue Type:** Story  
**Project:** echo-architect  
**Summary:** Implement flexible JSON product data storage in DynamoDB  

**Description:**
As a system administrator, I want to store product specifications in a flexible JSON format, so that I can accommodate varying product attributes without schema constraints.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN product data is stored in the database THE SYSTEM SHALL support flexible JSON schema for product attributes
2. WHEN a product record is created THE SYSTEM SHALL include mandatory fields: productId, name, category, brand
3. WHEN product data is persisted THE SYSTEM SHALL store additional custom attributes in JSON format
4. WHEN the database is initialized THE SYSTEM SHALL populate sample product data automatically

**Technical Notes:**
- Use DynamoDB as the storage backend
- Design schema to support flexible JSON attributes
- Implement data validation for mandatory fields
- Create initialization script for sample data

**Story Points:** 8  
**Priority:** High

## Story 2: Create RESTful Product Retrieval API Endpoints

**Issue Type:** Story  
**Project:** echo-architect  
**Summary:** Create RESTful product retrieval API endpoints  

**Description:**
As an API consumer, I want to retrieve product specifications through REST endpoints, so that I can access product information programmatically.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN a GET request is made to /products THE SYSTEM SHALL return a list of all products
2. WHEN a GET request is made to /products/{productId} THE SYSTEM SHALL return specific product details
3. WHEN a product is not found THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 404 status code
4. WHEN API responses are returned THE SYSTEM SHALL format data as JSON

**Technical Notes:**
- Implement REST API using appropriate framework
- Follow RESTful conventions for endpoint design
- Include proper HTTP status codes
- Ensure JSON response format consistency

**Story Points:** 5  
**Priority:** High

## Story 3: Implement Product Filtering and Search Capabilities

**Issue Type:** Story  
**Project:** echo-architect  
**Summary:** Implement product filtering and search capabilities  

**Description:**
As an API consumer, I want to filter products by category and brand, so that I can retrieve relevant product subsets.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN a GET request includes category query parameter THE SYSTEM SHALL filter products by category
2. WHEN a GET request includes brand query parameter THE SYSTEM SHALL filter products by brand
3. WHEN multiple filters are applied THE SYSTEM SHALL return products matching all criteria
4. WHEN no products match filters THE SYSTEM SHALL return empty array with HTTP 200 status

**Technical Notes:**
- Implement query parameter parsing
- Support multiple filter combinations
- Optimize database queries for filtering
- Handle edge cases for empty results

**Story Points:** 5  
**Priority:** Medium

## Story 4: Ensure API Performance and Reliability Standards

**Issue Type:** Story  
**Project:** echo-architect  
**Summary:** Ensure API performance and reliability standards  

**Description:**
As an API consumer, I want fast and reliable API responses, so that I can integrate the service into production applications.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN API requests are made THE SYSTEM SHALL respond within 500ms for single product queries
2. WHEN API requests are made THE SYSTEM SHALL respond within 1000ms for filtered product lists
3. WHEN errors occur THE SYSTEM SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages
4. WHEN the API is deployed THE SYSTEM SHALL be available 99.9% of the time

**Technical Notes:**
- Implement performance monitoring
- Add proper error handling and logging
- Configure health checks and monitoring
- Optimize database queries for performance
- Implement caching strategies if needed

**Story Points:** 8  
**Priority:** High

## Story 5: Create Sample Product Data Management System

**Issue Type:** Story  
**Project:** echo-architect  
**Summary:** Create sample product data management system  

**Description:**
As a developer, I want sample product data available in the system, so that I can test API functionality immediately after deployment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN the system is deployed THE SYSTEM SHALL include at least 10 sample products
2. WHEN sample data is created THE SYSTEM SHALL include diverse product categories (electronics, clothing, books, etc.)
3. WHEN sample data is created THE SYSTEM SHALL include multiple brands per category
4. WHEN sample data is accessed THE SYSTEM SHALL demonstrate flexible JSON schema capabilities

**Technical Notes:**
- Create data seeding script or migration
- Include diverse product categories and brands
- Demonstrate flexible JSON schema with varying attributes
- Ensure sample data is realistic and useful for testing

**Story Points:** 3  
**Priority:** Medium

## Summary

Total Stories: 5  
Total Story Points: 29  
High Priority: 3 stories (21 points)  
Medium Priority: 2 stories (8 points)

**Dependencies:**
- Story 1 (Data Storage) must be completed before Story 2 (API Endpoints)
- Story 5 (Sample Data) should be completed early to support testing
- Stories 3 and 4 can be developed in parallel with Story 2

**Notes:**
- All stories are based on requirements from /Users/sadhupri/echo-architect-artifacts/product-specifications-api-102220251547/specs/requirements.md
- Stories follow standard Agile format with clear acceptance criteria
- Technical implementation details are included for development guidance
